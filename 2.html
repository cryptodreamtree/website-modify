      <h2>LUNA란 무엇인가?</h2>
      <strong>Luna (LUNA) and TerraUSD (UST)</strong> are two native tokens of the Terra network, a blockchain-based project developed by Terra Labs in South Korea.
      <p><a href="https://www.terra.money/"
        target="_blank" title="terra is good">The Terra blockchain</a> is built on <u>Cosmos SDK;</u> a framework that allows developers to create custom blockchains and build their own decentralized applications on top of Terra for various use cases.
      As of now, The Terra ecosystem contains more than 100 of these natively built projects. These include non-fungible token (NFT) collections, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and Web 3 applications.
      Founded by Do Kwon, a former Stanford University computer science grad who appeared on CoinDesk’s Most influential 2021 list, the Terra ecosystem has experienced tremendous growth recently. The market capitalization of UST grew from $180 million at the start of 2021 to almost $15 billion in March 2022, while LUNA’s price soared by 138-fold.
      In addition, the Washington Nationals baseball team announced a five-year sponsorship deal with Terra’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in February, a deal worth $40 million. It was said the team plans to accept UST as a payment option in the future.</p>
